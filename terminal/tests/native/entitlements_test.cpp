// entitlements_test.cpp - native pin on the client-side replay gating.
//
// Entitlements decides what the terminal LETS you click: how far back the
// scrubber reaches, which symbols replay, how fast, and whether a right-click
// offers "Replay from here" or an upgrade nudge. The Go backend enforces the
// real rule on every replay-session request, so nothing here is a security
// boundary. What it is instead is an agreement: the client must gate exactly
// what the server gates, because the two failure modes are both bad.
//
//   Client tighter than server -> the UI refuses clicks the backend would have
//   served. That already happened once: a hard-coded 30d reach made the
//   cryptohftdata backfill (~71 days back) unreachable even for admin, who had
//   a 90d claim minted into their token.
//
//   Client looser than server -> the user gets a doomed POST and an error modal
//   instead of a locked control that explains itself.
//
// Every window function takes now_ms as a PARAMETER rather than reading a clock,
// which is what makes this file deterministic. The tests below drive it from a
// fixed epoch instead of "now".
